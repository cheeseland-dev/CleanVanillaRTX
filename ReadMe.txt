Hello!

To install this, as long as you have the Bedrock RTX beta, all that should be necessary is double clicking
the "CleanVanillaRTX.mcpack" file. This should load it into your game, and during world creation, or
in the settings of an existing world, you should be able to activate it from the "my packs" section. If you
have any issues with this, feel free to dm me on discord, at YERT20082#0001.

This pack is a fork of RTX Vanilla Conversion by TheCivilHulk, so a ton of the work is credited to him, as I simply added some new 1.16 blocks as well as touched up on some others. This pack only works in RTX versions of 1.16 and above.

I also made all of the textures and RTX patches using TextureEdit, a free software programmed by u/warm_teeth on Reddit! If you'd like to download this and try it out yourself check out https://www.reddit.com/r/TextureEdit/ for information including two video tutorials created by yours truly! Feel free to leave any feedback, suggestions, or questions on the subreddit!

Enjoy,
YERT20082
